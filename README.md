# GPT From Scratch

A minimal, educational implementation of a tiny GPT‑style Transformer in Python. This is a work in progress.

## Getting Started
- Prerequisite: Python 3.10+.
- Run the notebook: open `gpt_from_scratch.ipynb` to explore step‑by‑step.
- Or run the script: `python main.py`.

## Project Structure
- `main.py` — simple entry point / experiments.
- `gpt_from_scratch.ipynb` — scratchpad notebook for iterative development.

## Status
- Active WIP: APIs and files may change frequently.

## Roadmap (short)
- Tokenization + data pipeline
- Tiny Transformer blocks
- Training loop on a toy dataset

## License
- TBD
